# concrete-semantics-exercises

I'm learning the [Isabelle/HOL theorem prover](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/) and reading [Concrete Semantics by Tobias Nipkow and Gerwin Klein](http://www.concrete-semantics.org/) for that purpose.

## Useful resources for learning Isabelle/HOL
* [Functional Data Structures Course](http://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/FDS/SS17/)
* [Isabelle's Tutorial](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/tutorial.pdf)
* [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/)

Note: I don't know if I'm going to finish every exercise from the book. My goal is to learn PL semantics and how to formalize it (and have a lot of fun on the way).
